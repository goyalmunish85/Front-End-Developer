<h3>Me :</h3>

<em>First of all I would like to say <q>Hello</q> to myself.</em> I guess 
now in future I worked as Developer. I think I setup my own empire and I 
worked as full time web developer in MNC companies.</p>

<p>

Today I know only c language and some knowledge about the 
html,css,javascript and jquery but now a start a nanodegree my udacity. 
This nanodegree is my first nanodegree by udacity. This platform is new for 
me. I am so excited to do. Now I starts the nanodegree as <i>Front End 
Developer</i>. But the seeing the videos of toturials is too booring but I 
do. It is no longer simply <q>learning to code is so hard</q>. 

</p>

<p>

My friends says to me nanodegree is so typical but I don't hear them. But 
now I face the some problems but I know the I handle the all problems.
